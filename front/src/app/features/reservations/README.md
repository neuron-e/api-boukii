# Reservations Feature

This module showcases a complete reservation management dashboard with mock data.

## Development
- Route is registered under `/reservations`.
- `ReservationsMockService` provides sample reservations and quick stats.
- Dashboard includes header actions, quick statistics, advanced filters and dual list/calendar views.
- Clicking a reservation opens `ReservationDetailComponent` inside a material dialog.

Run unit tests with:
```bash
npm test src/app/features/reservations
```
